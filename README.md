These are the first pre-release versions of the `fullstackhero .NET WebAPI Boilerplate` package. Newer versions will be available on a weekly basis with newer updates and patches. [Read the getting-started guide for more.](https://fullstackhero.net/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/getting-started/)

The Release Version v1 is expected to be out by December 20th or earlier. Preview versions of this project are available for Initial Developer Testing. 0.0.5 RC is the most stable version of this API currently.

## Quick Start Guide

Open up your Command Prompt / Powershell and run the following command to install the solution template.

```powershell
dotnet new --install FullStackHero.WebAPI.Boilerplate
```
This would install the `fullstackhero .NET WebAPI Boilerplate` template globally on your machine. With that done, let's see how you can start generating complete .NET WebAPI Solutions seamlessly.

Simply navigate to a new directory (wherever you want to place your new solution), and open up Command Prompt at the opened directory.

Run the following command. Note that, in this demonstration, I am naming my new solution as `FSH.Starter`.

```powershell
dotnet new fsh-api -o FSH.Starter
```
